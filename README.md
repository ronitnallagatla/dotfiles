Decided to get a basic Arch Linux setup going. I'm running it on a removable external SSD so that I can switch between Windows and Linux. It seems to be pretty stable so far. 

## TODO
- Get nvidia optimus working, battery life is abysmal rn
- Configure trackpad gestures for i3 navigation, or just get on hyprland
- Figure out how to make some apps not tile by default

## Fetch
